	abstract = {Unsupervised protein language models trained across millions of diverse sequences learn structure and function of proteins. Protein language models studied to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evolutionarily related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families. The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior state-of-the-art protein language models.},

	abstract = {Learning the design patterns of proteins from sequences across evolution may have promise toward generative protein design. However it is unknown whether language models, trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins to generate de novo proteins. We focus on two protein design tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified, and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or 67\%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to the nearest sequence match is at median 27\%, below 20\% for 6 designs, and as low as 18\% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone design, the language model generates successful designs for each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129 or 55\%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar structural contexts in known protein families. The results show that language models, though only trained on sequences, learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein structure, extending beyond natural proteins.},

            Optical density (OD) measurements of microbial growth are one of the most common techniques used in microbiology, with applications ranging from studies of antibiotic efficacy to investigations of growth under different nutritional or stress environments, to characterization of different mutant strains, including those harbouring synthetic circuits. OD measurements are performed under the assumption that the OD value obtained is proportional to the cell number, i.e. the concentration of the sample. However, the assumption holds true in a limited range of conditions, and calibration techniques that determine that range are currently missing. Here we present a set of calibration procedures and considerations that are necessary to successfully estimate the cell concentration from OD measurements.},

	abstract = {Growth curve measurements are commonly used in microbiology, while the use of microplate readers for such measurements provides better temporal resolution and higher throughput. However, evaluating bacterial growth with microplate readers has been hurdled by barriers such as multiple scattering. Here, we report our development of a method based on the time derivatives of the optical density (OD) and/or fluorescence (FL) of bacterial cultures to overcome these barriers. First, we illustrated our method using quantitative models and numerical simulations, which predicted the number of bacteria and the number of fluorescent proteins in time as well as their time derivatives. Then, we systematically investigated how the time derivatives depend on the parameters in the models/simulations, providing a framework for understanding the FL growth curves. In addition, as a demonstration, we applied our method to study the lag time elongation of bacteria subjected to treatment with silver (Ag
              +
              ) ions and found that the results from our method corroborated well with that from growth curve fitting by the Gompertz model that has been commonly used in the literature. Furthermore, this method was applied to the growth of bacteria in the presence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at various concentrations, where the OD curve measurements failed. We showed that our method allowed us to successfully extract the growth behavior of the bacteria from the FL measurements and understand how the growth was affected by the AgNPs.},

However, the OD alone is an unreliable metric and is only proportionately accurate to cell titers to about an OD of 0.1. The relationship between OD and cell titer depends on the configuration of the spectrophotometer, the length of the light path through the culture, the size of the bacterial cells, and the cell culture density. We demonstrate the importance of plate reader calibration to identify the exact relationship between OD and cells/mL. We use four bacterial genera and two sizes of micro-titer plates (96-well and 384-well) to show that the cell/ml per unit OD depends heavily on the bacterial cell size and plate size. We applied our calibration curve to real growth curve data and conclude the cells/mL–rather than OD–is a metric that can be used to directly compare results across experiments, labs, instruments, and species.},

	abstract = {The relative linear order of most genes on bacterial chromosomes is not conserved over evolutionary timescales. One explanation is that selection is weak, allowing recombination to randomize gene order by genetic drift. However, most chromosomal rearrangements are deleterious to fitness. In contrast, we propose the hypothesis that rearrangements in gene order are more likely the result of selection during niche adaptation (SNAP). Partial chromosomal duplications occur very frequently by recombination between direct repeat sequences. Duplicated regions may contain tens to hundreds of genes and segregate quickly unless maintained by selection. Bacteria exposed to non-lethal selections (for example, a requirement to grow on a poor nutrient) can adapt by maintaining a duplication that includes a gene that improves relative fitness. Further improvements in fitness result from the loss or inactivation of non-selected genes within each copy of the duplication. When genes that are essential in single copy are lost from different copies of the duplication, segregation is prevented even if the original selection is lifted. Functional gene loss continues until a new genetic equilibrium is reached. The outcome is a rearranged gene order. Mathematical modelling shows that this process of positive selection to adapt to a new niche can rapidly drive rearrangements in gene order to fixation. Signature features (duplication formation and divergence) of the SNAP model were identified in natural isolates from multiple species showing that the initial two steps in the SNAP process can occur with a remarkably high frequency. Further bioinformatic and experimental analyses are required to test if and to which extend the SNAP process acts on bacterial genomes.},

	abstract = {Tandem duplications are among the most common mutation events. The high loss rate of duplication suggested that the frequency of duplications in a bacterial population (1/1000) might reﬂect a steady state dictated by relative rates of formation (k F) and loss (k L). This possibility was tested for three genetic loci. Without homologous recombination (RecA), duplication loss rate dropped essentially to zero, but formation rate decreased only slightly and a steady state was still reached rapidly. Under all conditions, steady state was reached faster than predicted by formation and loss rates alone. A major factor in determining steady state proved to be the ﬁtness cost, which can exceed 40\% for some genomic regions. Depending on the region tested, duplications reached 40–98\% of the steady-state frequency within 30 generations—approximately the growth required for a single cell to produce a saturated overnight culture or form a large colony on solid medium (109 cells). Long-term bacterial populations are stably polymorphic for duplications of every region of their genome. These polymorphisms contribute to rapid genetic adaptation by providing frequent preexisting mutations that are beneﬁcial whenever imposed selection favors increases in some gene activity. While the reported results were obtained with the bacterium Salmonella enterica, the genetic implications seem likely to be of broader biological relevance.},

              Optical density (OD) is widely used to estimate the density of cells in liquid culture, but cannot be compared between instruments without a standardized calibration protocol and is challenging to relate to actual cell count. We address this with an interlaboratory study comparing three simple, low-cost, and highly accessible OD calibration protocols across 244 laboratories, applied to eight strains of constitutive GFP-expressing
              E. coli
              . Based on our results, we recommend calibrating OD to estimated cell count using serial dilution of silica microspheres, which produces highly precise calibration (95.5\% of residuals  {\textless}1.2-fold), is easily assessed for quality control, also assesses instrument effective linear range, and can be combined with fluorescence calibration to obtain units of Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescein (MEFL) per cell, allowing direct comparison and data fusion with flow cytometry measurements: in our study, fluorescence per cell measurements showed only a 1.07-fold mean difference between plate reader and flow cytometry data.},
